- **Non-Shippable Products**: Such as scratch cards and digital products

### Shopping Cart
- Add products with specific quantities
- Validate product availability
- Check product expiration status
- Real-time inventory management

### Payment System
- Calculate subtotal for all items
- Apply shipping fees (30 for shippable items)
- Validate customer balance
- Generate detailed receipts
- Update customer balance and inventory

### Shipping Processing
- Collect shippable items automatically
- Calculate total package weight
- Generate shipping notices
- Integrate with ShippingService

## Project Structure (Simplified)

```
src/
├── Products.java      # All product classes and interfaces
├── Cart.java          # Shopping cart and customer classes
├── Services.java      # Payment and shipping services
├── Exceptions.java    # Custom exception classes
└── Main.java         # Main test class with comprehensive test cases
```

### File Details:

#### Products.java
- `Product` - Abstract base product class
- `ExpirableProduct` - Products with expiry dates
- `NonExpirableProduct` - Products without expiry dates
- `Shippable` - Interface for shippable products
- `Cheese`, `Biscuits`, `TV`, `Mobile`, `ScratchCard` - Concrete product implementations

#### Cart.java
- `CartItem` - Individual cart item representation
- `Cart` - Shopping cart with item management
- `Customer` - Customer information and balance

#### Services.java
- `ShippingService` - Handles shipping calculations and notices
- `CheckoutService` - Manages checkout process and validation

#### Exceptions.java
- `EmptyCartException` - Cart validation
- `ExpiredProductException` - Product expiry validation
- `InsufficientBalanceException` - Payment validation
- `OutOfStockException` - Inventory validation

## Requirements
- Java 8 or higher

## How to Run

### Compilation
```bash
javac src/*.java
```

### Execution
```bash
java -cp src Main
```

## Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Normal Checkout
- Add cheese, biscuits, and scratch card
- Process payment with shipping
- Display shipment notice and receipt

### Test Case 2: Empty Cart Validation
- Attempt checkout with empty cart
- Display appropriate error message

### Test Case 3: Insufficient Balance
- Attempt to purchase expensive item with low balance
- Validate payment constraints

### Test Case 4: Out of Stock Validation
- Attempt to purchase more items than available
- Check inventory management

### Test Case 5: Expired Product Validation
- Attempt to purchase expired product
- Validate expiry date checking

### Test Case 6: Multiple Items with Shipping
- Purchase mix of shippable and non-shippable items
- Calculate shipping fees correctly

### Test Case 7: Non-Shippable Items Only
- Purchase only non-shippable items
- Verify no shipping fees applied

## Design Patterns & Best Practices

### Object-Oriented Design
- **Inheritance**: Product hierarchy with abstract classes
- **Polymorphism**: Different product types with common interface
- **Encapsulation**: Private fields with public getters/setters
- **Abstraction**: Abstract classes defining common behavior

### Exception Handling
- Custom exceptions for specific business rules
- Comprehensive error messages
- Graceful error handling in test cases

### SOLID Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one clear purpose
- **Open/Closed**: Easy to extend with new product types
- **Liskov Substitution**: Subtypes are interchangeable
- **Interface Segregation**: Focused interfaces (Shippable)
- **Dependency Inversion**: Services depend on abstractions

## Assumptions & Business Rules

1. **Shipping Fees**: Fixed 30 currency units for shippable items
2. **Weight Units**: Products stored in kg, displayed in grams
3. **Expiry Validation**: Products compared against current date
4. **Balance Management**: Automatic deduction after successful payment
5. **Inventory Management**: Automatic quantity reduction after purchase
6. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation with clear error messages

## Advanced Features

### Enhanced Error Handling
- Specific exception types for different scenarios
- Detailed error messages with context
- Graceful degradation in test scenarios

### Flexible Product System
- Easy to add new product types
- Support for both physical and digital products
- Configurable shipping and expiry rules

### Comprehensive Testing
- 7 different test scenarios
- Edge case coverage
- Real-world usage simulation

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Efficiency
- Minimal object creation
- Efficient data structures
- Clean object lifecycle management

### Code Quality
- Clean, readable code structure
- Comprehensive comments
- Consistent naming conventions
- Modular design for easy maintenance

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- Database integration for persistent storage
- User authentication and authorization
- Payment gateway integration
- Real-time inventory tracking
- Order history and management
- Discount and promotion system
- Multi-language support
- API endpoints for web integration
